Future Feature Proposal: Integration of zod-to-json-schema for API Validation and Documentation
Objective: Enhance API validation and documentation by integrating the zod-to-json-schema package to generate JSON schemas directly from Zod schemas.

Key Benefits:

Consistency Across Client and Server: Allows seamless sharing of validation schemas between client and server, ensuring consistent API behavior.

Improved API Documentation: Automatically generates JSON schemas that can be integrated into OpenAPI or Swagger, reducing manual effort and keeping the documentation in sync with the code.

Streamlined Workflow: Simplifies schema validation for both requests and responses, minimizing errors and improving development efficiency.

Potential Use Cases:

Runtime Validation: Use the generated JSON schemas with validation libraries like AJV for request/response validation.

Automated API Documentation: Integrate the JSON schemas into tools like Swagger or OpenAPI for automatically generated and always-up-to-date API docs.

Implementation Steps:

Install zod-to-json-schema via npm or yarn.

Integrate Zod schemas within the project to define API request and response structures.

Use zod-to-json-schema to convert these schemas into JSON schemas.

Incorporate JSON schemas into OpenAPI documentation or runtime validation logic.

Impact: This feature will improve both development efficiency and the reliability of APIs by ensuring better validation and documentation practices.
