# Requirements Document for GitHub Read-Only MCP Server

---

### **1. Project Overview**
The purpose of this project is to develop a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server capable of providing read-only access to Adrianaâ€™s GitHub repositories. The server will act as a resource for extracting repository information, facilitating AI-assisted solutions, and ensuring a secure, structured response.

---

### **2. Functional Requirements**
1. **Authentication**  
   - The server must authenticate using a GitHub personal access token with `read-only` permissions.  
   - It must securely store and manage the access token.

2. **Tool Definition**  
   - Create a tool within the MCP server for interacting with the GitHub API.  
   - Tool should accept input parameters such as:
     - Repository name.  
     - File path.  
     - Branch name.  

3. **GitHub API Integration**  
   - Use GitHub REST API for integration.  
   - Leverage the `node-fetch` package to make API requests.  
   - Fetchable data includes:
     - Repository metadata (name, description, last updated).  
     - List of files and directories.  
     - File contents in text format.

4. **Additional Functionalities**  
   - Provide the ability to retrieve a **list of all repositories** for the user.  
   - Provide the ability to retrieve a **specific repository** by its name.  

5. **Access Control**  
   - Ensure only read access; prohibit modifications to repositories.  

6. **Response Formatting**  
   - Output structured data (e.g., JSON or similar).  
   - Provide clear error messages for failed queries.  

7. **Deployment**  
   - Deploy the MCP server on a secure hosting platform.  
   - Ensure high availability and minimal latency for client requests.

### **3. Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Security**  
   - Use HTTPS for secure communication.  
   - Encrypt sensitive data like tokens.

2. **Scalability**  
   - Design the server to handle multiple simultaneous requests.  
   - Implement caching for frequent queries to reduce API load.

3. **Performance**  
   - Ensure fast response times (<500ms per query).  
   - Optimize API calls to minimize rate-limiting issues.

4. **Rate Limiting**  
   - Implement mechanisms to **avoid hitting GitHub API's rate limits**, such as:
     - Caching results for repeated queries.  
     - Using conditional requests with ETags.  

---

### **4. Technical Specifications**
- **Programming Language:** TypeScript/JavaScript.  
- **Framework:** Node.js with Express (optional).  
- **HTTP Client Library:** `node-fetch`.  
- **GitHub SDK:** GitHub REST API integration.  
- **Deployment Platform:** AWS, Azure, or Vercel (based on user preference).

### **5. Milestones & Deliverables**
1. **Design Phase**  
   - Finalize architecture and tool specifications.  
2. **Development Phase**  
   - Build authentication and API integration.  
   - Implement "list all repositories" and "get a single repository" features.  
   - Test response formatting.  
3. **Deployment Phase**  
   - Deploy to production and conduct final testing.  
4. **Documentation & Handover**  
   - Deliver user guide and technical documentation.
